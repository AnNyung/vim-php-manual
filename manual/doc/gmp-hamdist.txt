  int gmp_hamdist(GMP a, GMP b)~

Returns the hamming distance between {a} and {b}. Both operands should be
non-negative.

{a} Either a GMP number resource in PHP 5.5 and earlier, a GMP object in PHP
5.6 and later, or a numeric string provided that it is possible to convert the

|gmp_hamdist| example

<?php >
  $ham1 = gmp_init("1001010011", 2);
  $ham2 = gmp_init("1011111100", 2);
  echo gmp_hamdist($ham1, $ham2) . "\n";
  
  /* hamdist is equivalent to: */
  echo gmp_popcount(gmp_xor($ham1, $ham2)) . "\n";
?>

The above example will output:
